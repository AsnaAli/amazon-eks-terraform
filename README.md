# Amazon EKS Deployment with Terraform

This repository provides a Terraform script to deploy an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, simplifying the deployment and management of containerized applications. By leveraging Terraform as an infrastructure-as-code tool, you can automate the provisioning and management of the EKS cluster, ensuring repeatability, version control, and collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI with your AWS credentials.
- Terraform: Install Terraform to manage your infrastructure as code. (I used my Windows workstation)

## Installation Instructions

To deploy the EKS cluster, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the AWS CLI with your AWS credentials.
3. Navigate to the repository directory.
4. Modify the Terraform variables in the `main.tf` file according to your requirements (e.g., region, cluster name, subnet IDs).
5. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
6. Run `terraform plan` to review the planned changes.
7. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the EKS cluster.
8. Wait for the deployment to complete. This may take several minutes.
9. Once the cluster is deployed, you can access the Kubernetes configuration (kubeconfig) generated by Terraform.
10. To deploy the Apache pod in your EKS cluster, Run `kubectl apply -f apache-pod.yaml`. The apache-pod.yaml file is also shared. 

## Usage Examples

Here are a few examples to help you understand how to use this Terraform script:

- To customize the cluster configuration, modify the variables in the `main.tf` file before running `terraform apply`.
- To scale the cluster or adjust the instance types, update the desired capacity and instance type in the Terraform script.
- To tear down the cluster and release resources, run `terraform destroy`.

## Folder Structure

This repository has the following folder structure:

- `/terraform`: Contains the Terraform script for deploying the EKS cluster.
